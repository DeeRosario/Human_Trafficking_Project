# Human Trafficking Project
For this project I utilized Python in order to perform an initial data analysis and a secondary exploratory analysis of the FBI’s Human Trafficking Database in order to derive insights and suggest strategies into how bad human trafficking is currently in US and try to look for ways to minimize it or eliminate it.
# About the client
In this project there is no specific client. This project is open for and can be utilized by any agency, organization or NGO that is looking for answers concerning the growing threat of human trafficking in the United States. 
# Objective
Human Trafficking is a global problem. It is a problem that cannot be tackled all at once due to the sheer size of the global operation. This does not mean, however, that it cannot be dismantled. Like a Lego structure, just like it was built piece by piece, it can be dismantled piece by piece. The objective of this project is to start with one of the big client pieces, the United States, and find where trafficking is most commonplace, which law enforcement agency is most involved in combating this problem and provide recommendations for this agency or agencies to improve and increase their enforcement powers and abilities in order to severely cut down or eliminate human trafficking in the US.
# Key Questions
1.	How many people are trafficked for slave(manual) labor? – about 15% are trafficked in the US every year for slave(manual) labor.
2.	What percentage are underaged? - No data is provided in the dataframe to answer this question.
3.	What percentage are trafficked by family? (for example to get money?) - No data is provided in the dataframe to answer this question.
4.	What percentage are trafficked to enter another country? - No data is provided in the dataframe to answer this question.
5.	Which state sees the largest number of trafficked individuals? – Three states show high trafficking activity every year: Texas, Nevada and Minnesota.
6.	What percentage of people are trafficked children vs adults? - No data is provided in the notebook to answer this question.
7.	What percentage of people are trafficked for financial gain? -About 82% of the people in the FBI dataframe are trafficked for financial gain. These people are trafficked for sex.
# Data Utilized
All the data utilized for this project came from the FBI Human Trafficking Database found at www.FBI.org.  This database was created by the FBI so all law enforcement agencies across the US (both state and federal) could share all information they had on human trafficking cases they have encountered.
# Tools
The following Python libraries were used in this analysis project:
1.	Pandas
2.	Seaborn
3.	Matplotlib
4.	Numpy
5.	Pylab
6.	Sklearn
7.	Folium
8.	JSON
